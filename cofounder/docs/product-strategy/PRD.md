# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Cofounder - AI-Powered Full-Stack Application Generator

## Executive Summary
Cofounder is a comprehensive platform for rapid prototyping, product management, and full-scale application development with integrated agile methodologies. It transforms user descriptions into complete, production-ready applications.

## Product Vision
To democratize software development by enabling anyone to create sophisticated applications through natural language descriptions and AI-powered generation, while maintaining professional development standards and best practices.

## Core Objectives
1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Generate complete applications from descriptions in minutes
2. **Full-Stack Generation**: Create frontend, backend, database, and API specifications
3. **Agile Integration**: Built-in project management with Linear integration (planned)
4. **3D Prototyping**: Unity integration for digital twin creation (planned)
5. **Self-Improvement**: The tool can work on its own codebase

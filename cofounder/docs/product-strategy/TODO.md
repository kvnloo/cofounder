- [ ] Launch console.cofounder.openinterface.ai
- [ ] Integrate with online development workflows

### Quality & Validation  
- [ ] Post-generation validation swarm modules
- [ ] Automated error detection and fixing
- [ ] Enhanced Babel parsing for better AST analysis
- [ ] Code quality metrics and reporting

### Build & Deployment
- [ ] Vite plugin for clean project generation (without cofounder modules)
- [ ] Generate deployment-ready project packages
- [ ] Automate deployments to various platforms (Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
- [ ] Container-based deployment options

## ðŸš€ Medium-term Goals (Q2-Q3 2025)

### Design & UI Enhancement
- [ ] Plug in advanced AI-powered designer models
- [ ] Enhanced layout generation with multiple design systems
- [ ] 3D visualization for project architecture
- [ ] Advanced component library integration

### Collaboration Features

## Self-Development Integration Notes

This TODO list should be used by Cofounder's self-development workflow:

1. **Priority Assessment**: Use PM:PRD functions to evaluate task priorities
2. **Implementation Planning**: Apply FRD analysis to define implementation approaches  
3. **Quality Assurance**: Use swarm functions to validate all improvements
4. **Progress Tracking**: Maintain this document as a living roadmap

*Last Updated: Based on comprehensive system analysis (commit 225c09f)*
document how to custom design systems
add & index docs for shiny design systems
fonts / css modules
release extensive cofounder index on api access for layout designer to use
separate {desktop,mobile} in designer
RAG on icons via {text/clip} (like in openv0), maybe as a vite plugin

## functional
deploy latest index checkpoint in api.cofounder

## mgmt
more iteration modules, sequences to handle full lifecycle of generated projects
document everything

## platforms
react-native / flutter
more frontend frameworks

## project
technical articles
model train & serve from api
admin panel Ã  la coolify

## also
SEO stuff
analytics into the dev feedback
animation (ie. framer-motion)
functional, api, python support api-side
benchmarks

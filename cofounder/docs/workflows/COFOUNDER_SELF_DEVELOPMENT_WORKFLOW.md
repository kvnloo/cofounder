# Cofounder Self-Development Workflow

## Overview

Cofounder uses a systematic, sequence-based workflow engine to generate projects. For Cofounder to work on itself, it must follow the same structured approach it uses for any other project. This document outlines how Cofounder can understand and enhance its own codebase using its established workflows.

## Core Workflow Engine Architecture

### 1. Sequence-Based Generation (`seq:project:init:v1`)

Cofounder follows a predefined sequence for all project generation:

```yaml
sequences:
 "seq:project:init:v1":
  desc: "user creates project with initial set of details{}, builds different layers until app generated"
  nodes:
   # Project Setup
   - op:PROJECT::STATE:SETUP
   
   # Product Management Layer
   - PM:PRD::ANALYSIS      # Product Requirements Document
   - PM:FRD::ANALYSIS      # Functional Requirements Document  
   - PM:DRD::ANALYSIS      # Data Requirements Document
   - PM:UXSMD::ANALYSIS    # UX Specification and Mockup Document
   
   # Database Layer
   - DB:SCHEMAS::GENERATE  # Generate database schemas
   - DB:POSTGRES::GENERATE # Generate PostgreSQL implementation
   
   # Business Requirements
   - PM:BRD::ANALYSIS      # Business Requirements Document
   
   # Backend Layer
   - BACKEND:OPENAPI::DEFINE    # REST API specifications
   - BACKEND:ASYNCAPI::DEFINE   # WebSocket API specifications  
   - BACKEND:SERVER::GENERATE   # Express.js server generation
   
   # UX Design Layer
   - PM:UXDMD::ANALYSIS         # UX Design and Mockup Document
   - UX:SITEMAP::STRUCTURE      # Site structure mapping
   - UX:DATAMAP::STRUCTURE      # Data flow mapping
   - UX:DATAMAP::VIEWS         # View-specific data mapping
   
   # Frontend Layer
   - WEBAPP:STORE::GENERATE     # Redux store generation
   - WEBAPP:ROOT::GENERATE      # Root component generation
   - WEBAPP:VIEW::GENERATE:MULTI # Multi-view generation
```

### 2. Function System Structure

Each workflow node corresponds to a function in `/cofounder/api/system/functions/`:

```

│   ├── prd.js   # Product Requirements Document
│   ├── frd.js   # Functional Requirements Document
│   ├── drd.js   # Data Requirements Document

├── op/          # Operations
│   ├── analyze.js      # Project analysis
│   ├── ast-analyzer.js # AST parsing
│   ├── project-cache.js # Caching
│   └── project.js      # Project operations
└── swarm/       # Quality Assurance
    ├── review.js    # Code review
    ├── augment.js   # Enhancement
    └── fix.js       # Bug fixes
```

## Self-Development Workflow Application

### For Cofounder to Work on Itself:

#### 1. **Project Analysis Phase**
```javascript
// Use existing analyze.js function
POST /api/project/analyze
{
  "project_path": "/path/to/cofounder"
}

// This triggers:
// - AST analysis of all JavaScript/TypeScript files
// - Dependency graph generation  
// - Architecture mapping
// - Component relationship analysis
```

#### 2. **Requirements Documentation**
Cofounder should generate its own requirements documents:

- **PRD**: Product vision for Cofounder improvements
- **FRD**: Functional requirements for new features
- **DRD**: Data requirements for enhanced capabilities
- **BRD**: Business requirements for platform evolution

#### 3. **Architecture Analysis**
Using its own `ast-analyzer.js`:

```javascript
const analyzer = new ASTAnalyzer('/path/to/cofounder');
await analyzer.analyzeProject();
// Results in comprehensive understanding of:
// - Component hierarchy
// - Import/export relationships  
// - Function dependencies
// - System boundaries
```

#### 4. **Enhancement Generation**
Following the same sequence for self-improvement:

1. **Backend Enhancements**: New API endpoints, improved authentication
2. **Frontend Improvements**: Enhanced UI components, better visualization
3. **Database Optimizations**: Better caching, improved schemas
4. **Workflow Extensions**: New generation capabilities

## Self-Development Use Cases

### 1. **Feature Addition Workflow**

```yaml
# Example: Adding new AI provider support
sequence: "seq:cofounder:enhance:ai-provider"
nodes:
  - PM:PRD::ANALYSIS           # Define AI provider requirements
  - PM:FRD::ANALYSIS          # Specify integration functions
  - BACKEND:SERVER::ENHANCE    # Add new authentication endpoint
  - WEBAPP:VIEW::ENHANCE       # Update settings UI
  - SWARM:REVIEW::VALIDATE     # Quality assurance
```

### 2. **Architecture Improvement Workflow**

```yaml  
# Example: Optimizing AST analysis performance
sequence: "seq:cofounder:optimize:ast"
nodes:
  - OP:ANALYZE::CURRENT        # Analyze current performance
  - PM:DRD::ANALYSIS          # Data flow requirements
  - OP:PROJECT-CACHE::ENHANCE  # Improve caching strategy
  - SWARM:REVIEW::PERFORMANCE  # Performance validation
```

### 3. **Documentation Generation Workflow**

```yaml
# Example: Auto-generating documentation
sequence: "seq:cofounder:docs:generate"  
nodes:
  - OP:ANALYZE::CODEBASE       # Analyze all functions
  - PM:UXDMD::DOCS            # Documentation design
  - WEBAPP:VIEW::DOCS         # Generate doc website
  - SWARM:REVIEW::DOCS        # Documentation review
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Self-Analysis
1. **Run project analysis** on Cofounder's own codebase
2. **Generate architecture documentation** using AST analysis  
3. **Create dependency maps** for all system functions
4. **Identify improvement opportunities** through code analysis

### Phase 2: Self-Enhancement Pipeline
1. **Create enhancement PRDs** for identified improvements
2. **Follow standard workflow** for implementing changes
3. **Use swarm functions** for quality assurance
4. **Apply iterative improvement** cycles

### Phase 3: Recursive Development
1. **Enable Cofounder to propose improvements** to its own code
2. **Implement self-code review** using swarm/review.js
3. **Create feedback loops** for continuous improvement
4. **Establish quality gates** for self-modifications

## Key Integration Points

### 1. **Claude Code Bridge Integration**
- Use Claude Code for complex reasoning about architectural changes
- Leverage AI for code generation and optimization suggestions
- Maintain human oversight for critical system changes

### 2. **AST Analysis Integration**  
- Real-time understanding of code changes
- Impact analysis for proposed modifications
- Dependency tracking for safe refactoring

### 3. **Workflow Engine Integration**
- All self-improvements follow the same sequence patterns
- Consistent quality assurance through swarm functions
- Predictable enhancement cycles

## Self-Development Commands

### Analyzing Cofounder
```bash
# Analyze Cofounder's own structure
POST /api/project/analyze
{
  "project_path": "/path/to/cofounder",
  "self_analysis": true
}
```

### Self-Enhancement
```bash  
# Start self-improvement sequence
POST /api/projects/new
{
  "project": "cofounder-enhancement-v2",
  "description": "Enhance Cofounder's AST analysis capabilities with real-time performance optimization",
  "blueprint": "cofounder_self_analysis_result"
}
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Self-code review
POST /api/project/actions  
{
  "project": "cofounder-enhancement-v2",
  "action": "SWARM:REVIEW::VALIDATE",
  "target": "self"
}
```

## Benefits of Self-Development Workflow

1. **Consistency**: Uses the same proven workflow for self-improvement
2. **Quality**: Applies the same quality gates to its own code
3. **Traceability**: All changes follow documented sequences
4. **Safety**: Maintains human oversight while enabling AI enhancement
5. **Evolution**: Continuous improvement through recursive development

## Conclusion

By applying its own workflow engine to self-development, Cofounder can:
- Understand its own architecture comprehensively
- Propose and implement improvements systematically  
- Maintain code quality through established processes
- Enable recursive enhancement capabilities
- Create a sustainable development lifecycle

This approach ensures that Cofounder's self-development follows the same rigorous, systematic approach it uses for all other projects, maintaining consistency and quality while enabling continuous evolution.
